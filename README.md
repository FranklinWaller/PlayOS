PlayOS gives users an easy way to access their apps, games, storage, data, notifications and more. It is accessible from any device that has an internet browser. This allows you to pick up from any app where you left off. This is done by synchronizing the state between devices. Giving users a seamless experience.
 
PlayOS allows applications to communicate with each other in a sandboxed environment. This way apps can be integrated with each other, without building the infrastructure for it. Take for example the files app. It allows users to click on the file and choose which app to give access to that specific file/folder.

PlayOS can be integrated with any blockchain that supports some sort of programmable interface.

We are still porting code over to a decentralised manner, any help is greatly appreciated.
